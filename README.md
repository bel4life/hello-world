My ideas, thoughts and feelings about programming
I am a job changer - and am motivated to learn as much as I can about different programming languages and to apply them well in the real world, particularly in Fintech and for insights to aid organisations.
I commit this - to becoming a Python engineer first, then R, then SQL and then onto a Data Scientist role.
